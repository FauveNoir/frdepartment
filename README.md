frdepartment
============

`frdepartment` is a Python program <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr> which converts names of [french department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_department) into theire codes and vice versa, according to [`ISO 3166-2:FR`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:FR).

This program also mainly provides the support of my own [reform](http://taniere.info/ordinator/pprojets/departement/)â€¯(French only) of numeric codes into alphabetic codes.
